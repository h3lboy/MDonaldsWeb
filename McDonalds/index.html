                <p>McDonald's looks for the best locations within the marketplace to provide our customers with
                    convenience. We build quality restaurants in neighborhoods as well as airports, malls, tollways and
                    colleges at a value to our customers.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>You'll find that our restaurants reflect our commitment of giving back to the communities in which we
                    do business. When you walk into any one of our restaurants, you walk into a brand that extends into
                    the community. Whether our McDonaldâ€™s properties are built with a PlayPlace in your local
                    neighborhood or a business center in your local airport, we aim for every customer in every
                    restaurant to have the best quick-service restaurant experience, every time.</p>

                <h3>Property Site Criteria</h3>
                <p>If you have property for sale, McDonald's wants to hear from you. We just might want to build a
                    restaurant on your site. In the past, we have developed restaurants on smaller parcels and
                    significantly larger parcels. Give us the opportunity to look over your property site
                    characteristics.</p>
